case-661606: When tested on different OS these are the results, using the latest
tagged release of Tidy (5.1.25):

OS               Markup   Errors   Exit Status
--------------   ------   ------   -----------
Mac OS X 10.11   fail     pass     pass
Ubunutu 14.04    fail     pass     pass
Windows 10       pass     pass     pass

This appears to be an encoding-related issue, yet to be investigated.
