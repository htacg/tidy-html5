 *
 * This file is a localization file for HTML Tidy. It will have been machine
 * generated or created and/or edited by hand. Both are valid options, but
 * please help keep our localization efforts simple to maintain by maintaining
 * the structure of this file, and changing the check box below if you make
 * changes (so others know the file origin):
 *
 * [X] THIS FILE IS MACHINE GENERATED. It is a localization file for the
 *     language (and maybe region) "zh_cn". The source of
 *     these strings is a gettext PO file in Tidy's source, probably called 
 *     "language_zh_cn.po".
 *
 * [ ] THIS FILE WAS HAND MODIFIED. Translators, please feel to edit this file
 *     directly (and check this box). If you prefer to edit PO files then use
 *     `poconvert.rb msgunfmt language_zh_cn.h` (our own
 *     conversion tool) to generate a fresh PO from this file first!
