  Build 'tidy.1', which is a man page suitable for installation
  in all Unix-like operating systems. This script will build
  it, but not install it.
  
  Build 'quickref.html'. This is distributed with the
  the Tidy source code and also used on Tidy's website.
  Be sure to distribute it with 'quickref.css' as well.

  Build the 'tidylib_api' directory, which contains a website
  with the documentation for TidyLibâ€™s headers.
  
  These files will be built into '{current_dir}/temp'.
