This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

You are recommended to use CSS for controlling white
space (e.g. for indentation, margins and line spacing).
The proprietary <SPACER> element has limited vendor support.

One or more empty elements were present in the source document but
dropped on output. If these elements are necessary or you don't want
this behavior, then consider setting the option "drop-empty-elements"
to no.
