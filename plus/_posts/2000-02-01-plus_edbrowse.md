# edbrowse

`edbrowse` incorporates HTML Tidy 5 `libtidy` to help visually impaired people use the
internet.

>`edbrowse` is a combination editor, browser, and mail client that is 100% text based.
>The interface is similar to `/bin/ed`, though there are many more features, such as
>editing multiple files simultaneously and rendering html.
>
>This program was originally written for blind users, but many sighted users have taken
>advantage of the unique scripting capabilities of this program which can be found nowhere
>else.  A batch job or cron job can access web pages on the internet, submit forms, and
>send email, with no human intervention whatsoever.  

`edbrowse` can also tap into databases through ODBC.
