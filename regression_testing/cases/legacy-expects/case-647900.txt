You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>
tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements
are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>
in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is
placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the
table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!
