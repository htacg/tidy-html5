# HTML Tidy with HTML5 support

## Prerequisites

  1. git - http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
  
  2. cmake - http://www.cmake.org/download/
  
  3. appropriate build tools for the platform
  
CMake comes in two forms - command line and gui. Some installations only install one or the other, but sometimes both. The build commands below are only for the command line use.

Also the actual build tools vary for each platform. But that is one of the great features of cmake, it can generate variuous 'native' build files. Running cmake without any parameters will list the generators available on that platform. For sure one of the common ones is "Unix Makefiles", which needs autotools make installed, but many other generators are supported.

In windows cmake offers various versions of MSVC. Again below only the command line use of MSVC is shown, but the tidy solution (*.sln) file can be loaded into the MSVC IDE, and the building done in there.


## Build the tidy library and command line tool

  1. `cd build/cmake`

  2. `cmake ../.. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/for/install]`

  3. Windows:  `cmake --build . --config Release`  
     Unix/OS X: `make`

  4. Install, if desired:  
     Windows: `cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL`  
     Unix/OS X: `[sudo] make install`

By default cmake sets the install path to /usr/local in unix. If you wanted the binary in say /usr/bin instead, then in 2. above use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

Also, in unix if you want to build the release library without any debug `assert` in the code then add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` in step 2. This adds a `-DNDEBUG` macro to the compile switches. This is normally added in windows build for the `Release` config.

In windows the default install is to C:\Program Files\tidy5, or C:/Program Files (x86)/tidy5, which is  not very useful. After the build the tidy[n].exe is in the Release directory, and can be copied to any directory in your PATH environment variable, for global use.

If you do **not** need the tidy library built as a 'shared' (DLL) library, then in 2. add the command -DBUILD_SHARED_LIB:BOOL=OFF. This option is ON by default. The static library is always built and linked with the command line tool for convenience in windows, and so the binary can be run as part of the man page build without the shared library being installed in unix.

## Build PHP with the tidy-html5 library

Due to API changes in the PHP source, "buffio.h" needs to be changed to "tidy/buffio.h" in the file ext/tidy/tidy.c.

That is - prior to configuring php run this in the php source directory:
```
sed -i 's,buffio.h,tidy/buffio.h,' ext/tidy/*.c
```

And then continue with (just an example here, use your own php config options):

```
./configure --with-tidy=/usr/local
make
make test
make install
```

## Development

The default branch of this repository is `master`. This is the development branch, hopefully always `stable` source.

It will identify as library version X.odd.X. Use it to help us on the forever `bug` quest, addition of new features, options, ..., etc.

However, if you seek **release** code, then do `git branch -r`, and choose one of the `release/X.even.0` branches for your build and install...

This will always be the latest release branch. Important `bug` fixes thought relevant to this release, pushed back, may bump the library version to X.even.1, ..., etc, but will be remain known as `X.even`...

Some more details of the `Tidy Version` can be found in [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

Concerning the `Tidy Code Style`, some notes can be found in [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md).
