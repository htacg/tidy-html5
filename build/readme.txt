Tidy Build Files

Each subdirectory contains input files to a selected
build system for TidyLib and the command line driver.
Some build systems are cross-platform (gmake, autoconf),
others (msvc) are platform specific.  For details
on any given build system, see the readme file for
that system.

Common Build Options

There are some basic build options for TidyLib, independent
of platform and build system.  Typically, these options can
be enabled or disabled by setting a macro value within the
Makefile or its equivalent.  An option may be disabled by
setting its value to "0".  Enable by setting to "1".  Again,
consult the directions for each build system for details
on how to enable/disable each option.
