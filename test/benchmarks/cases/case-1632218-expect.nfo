case-1632218: When tested on different OS these are the results, using the 
latest tagged release of Tidy (5.1.25):

OS               Markup   Errors   Exit Status
--------------   ------   ------   -----------
Mac OS X 10.11   fail     pass     pass
Ubunutu 14.04    pass     pass     pass
Windows 10       pass     pass     pass

This appears to be a Mac OS X encoding-related issue, yet to be investigated.
