URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped
characters below U+0021 including the space character and not
above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by
HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents
use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided
scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must
escape the URI on your own. For more information please refer to
https://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html

One or more empty elements were present in the source document but
dropped on output. If these elements are necessary or you don't want
this behavior, then consider setting the option "drop-empty-elements"
to no.
