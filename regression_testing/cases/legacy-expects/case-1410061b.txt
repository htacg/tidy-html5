You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and
properties such as its size and color. This will reduce
the size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain
compared with using <FONT> elements.

One or more empty elements were present in the source document but
dropped on output. If these elements are necessary or you don't want
this behavior, then consider setting the option "drop-empty-elements"
to no.
