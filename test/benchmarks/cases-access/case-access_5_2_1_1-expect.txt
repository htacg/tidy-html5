line 8 column 1 - Access: [5.2.1.1]: data <table> may require markup (column headers).
 
      - First, search left from the cell's position to find row header cells.
      - Then search upwards to find column header cells.
      - The search in a given direction stops when the edge of the table is
        reached or when a data cell is found after a header cell.
      - Row headers are inserted into the list in the order they appear in
        the table. 
      - For left-to-right tables, headers are inserted from left to right.
      - Column headers are inserted after row headers, in 
        the order they appear in the table, from top to bottom. 
      - If a header cell has the headers attribute set, then the headers 
        referenced by this attribute are inserted into the list and the 
        search stops for the current direction.
        TD cells that set the axis attribute are also treated as header cells.
